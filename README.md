# Student Performance Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python.  
It demonstrates how raw data from a CSV file can be processed, structured using Object-Oriented Programming, and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.

The project is designed for beginners aiming to build a strong foundation in **Python for Data Science**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The input data is stored in a CSV file containing:
- Roll Number
- Student Name
- Marks in Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and English

---

## ⚙️ Features Implemented
- Reading data from CSV using file handling
- Creating a `Student` class using OOP concepts
- Storing student marks using dictionaries
- Calculating:
  - Subject-wise average marks
  - Student-wise average marks
  - Top performer
  - Pass/Fail count per student
- Generating a text-based performance report

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Python Fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Lists & Dictionaries
- File Handling
- Basic Data Analysis Logic

---

## 📊 Output
The program generates a text file:

which summarizes the complete performance analysis.

---

## 🚀 Why this project?
This project simulates a real-world data analysis workflow:
CSV → Python Objects → Analysis → Report Generation
